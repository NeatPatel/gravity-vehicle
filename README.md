# Building a Precision Landing Vehicle with Wingnut Stopping System

Welcome to this vehicle building project! Today, we're going to guide you through the process of creating a precision landing vehicle using a wingnut stopping system. With just a few materials and some creativity, you'll be able to propel your vehicle down a ramp and land it at a precise distance every time. Let's get started!

## Materials Needed:

- Laser Cutter with metal (specific metal specified on laser cutter page)
- 3D Printer with ample ABS filament
- Two 30 cm long, 0.79375 cm diameter threaded rods
- Four rollerblade wheels (11 cm diameter)
- 19 screws (6 larger flat head screws, 13 smaller combination head screws) with accompanying bolts and washers
- One yellow plastic bar cut from rod
- Four 22 mm diameter ball bearings
- Wing nut (0.79375 cm to fit on front rod) for braking system with a small wood block
- One 2.54 cm stainless steel cup hook with threading (for holding vehicle in place on ramp)
- Four larger screws for wheels (1.524 cm diameter of thread) with washers of the same diameter, and four hexes to hold in place, 1.524 cm diameter on one side and other side of diameter 0.79375 cm
- Green gear for back axles
- Safety resting dock made from an old wood block, slightly larger than necessary dimensions, shaved to dimensions with sandpaper, and placed on "bamboo stick" dowels, also shaved until reaching dimensions
- Wood glue
- Any regular building tools (screwdrivers, hammer, drill)

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Design and Cut Chassis Components

Using the laser cutter, design and cut out the chassis components from the specified metal. The body frame can be cut to 66.1 cm x 25.4cm. Below is an image of the 3D printed ball bearing holders:

Assembly begins with attaching 3D printed bearing holders to the metal body, and then metal bars, followed by screws (12, not 13), axles (2), green gear (failed experiment), wood block (initial alignment), metal hook, and egg resting components

Additional components of the building were added on as well: the wheels, hexes, washers, nuts, and screws as needed.


### 2. 3D Print Additional Parts

Utilize the 3D printer and ABS filament to print any additional parts needed for the vehicle, such as brackets, mounts, or covers.

### 3. Assemble Wheel System

Attach the rollerblade wheels to the chassis using the larger screws, washers, and hexes. Ensure they are securely fastened for smooth rolling.

### 4. Install Threaded Rods

Insert the threaded rods through the chassis, positioning them for the front and back axles of the vehicle.

### 5. Add Ball Bearings

Place the ball bearings onto the threaded rods to act as supports for the wheels, ensuring they spin freely.

### 6. Construct Braking System

Attach the wingnut to the front threaded rod, ensuring it can be tightened to act as a brake. Use the small wood block to align the wingnut properly.

### 7. Attach Cup Hook

Screw the stainless steel cup hook onto the chassis, providing a means to hold the vehicle in place on the ramp before launching.

### 8. Install Green Gear

Attach the green gear to the back axles, ensuring it meshes properly with the rollerblade wheels for propulsion.

### 9. Construct Safety Resting Dock

Build the safety resting dock using the old wood block, shaving it down to the necessary dimensions with sandpaper. Secure it in place using wood glue.

### 10. Finalize Assembly

Double-check all connections and ensure everything is securely fastened. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure the vehicle is balanced and stable.

Congratulations! You've successfully built a precision landing vehicle with a wingnut stopping system. Now it's time to test it out on the ramp and see how accurately you can land it at your desired distance.

Happy building and happy landing!
